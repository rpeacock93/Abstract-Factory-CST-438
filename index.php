			<h2>Game Description</h2>

			<p>Hurkle, a happy little beast, lives on the planet Lirht which is a flat world divided into 10 rows and columns. The Hurkle likes to hide randomly in one of those 100 plots on Lirht. It is the user's job to find the Hurkle. The player will enter a horizontal (x) coordinate, followed by a vertical (y) coordinate. The Hurkle will then give a clue as to where it is hiding</p>
